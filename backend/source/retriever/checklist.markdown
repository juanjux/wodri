Function signature:
* Add const to return parameter?
* Can some [], struct or class argument be made const?
* Can some struct argument be made ref?
* Can be pure?

Function body:
* strings and structs that will be initialized later can be 
  declared == null
* Can some local vars be immutable or const?
* Can I remove pointless local vars?
* If a foreach iterates over a list of structs, use ref
* "X in Y" returns a pointer so no need to double check
