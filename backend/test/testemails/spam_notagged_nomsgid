Well it is speculated that there are over 20,000 hosting companies in =
this country alone. WIth that many choices, you would think that people =
would generally be happy with their current hosting company. Not =
exactly the case, is it? You don't have to stick with your sub-par =
Host!
<p>
I'm Brian from SupremacyHosting.com inviting you to check out =
our site and hosting plans, chat with our friendly LiveChat reps, or =
eMail us anytime with any questions. And to help us determine the best =
methods of advertising, mention this eMail and get 30% off of your =
first month or 15% off of a yearly plan, regardless of the plan you =
choose. Plus, we'll help you effortlessly move your account from =
another hosting company over to our servers.=20
<p>
What we at =
Supremacy focus on primarily is support, because it's easy to match =
pricing/features of competitors, however to really succeed in this =
industry, you have to build a strong reputation of fast and helpful =
support. Supremacy will help you to transfer all of your data from your =
previous Host, we'll make sure you know how to access and use all of =
our 50+ Fantastico scripts to make your website really superb. We'll =
even help you to assist any customers you may have as a reseller!
<p>
In=
 case you are wondering who the heck we are, Supremacy started as a =
small local hosting division for San Diego technical companies only. =
After reaching what seemed to be the maximum growth potential, we =
decided to use our resources and experience to open to the entire =
market. And after only about 6 months, we have doubled in workforce =
numbers as growth has been phenomenal.
<p>
Here is a quick snapshot of =
our hosting plans; please note that all plans EXCEPT Economy are =
available for reselling. Likewise, all plans except Economy come with 2 =
months free if you choose to pay annually, Economy receives 1 month =
free.
<p>
Economy: 1.5GB of storage-- 25GB of transfer per month-- 75 =
POP Accounts-- Unlimited Subdomains-- 10 MySQL Databases-- CPanel over =
SSL-- Hosts up to 3 domains. $4.95/month ($54.45/year)
<p>
Basic: 3GB =
of storage-- 50GB of transfer per month-- Unlimited Subdomains-- 100 =
MySQL Databases-- WHM (administrative) CPanel over SSL-- Hosts =
Unlimited domains. $9.95/month ($99.50/year)
<p>
Business: 6GB of =
storage-- 75GB of transfer per month-- All of "Basic Plan" features =
plus Unlimited MySQL. $14.95/month ($149.50/year)
<p>
Advanced: 9GB of =
storage-- 100GB of transfer per month-- All of "Business Plan" =
features. $19.95/month ($199.50/year)
<p>
Corporate: 15GB of storage-- =
160GB of transfer per month-- All of "Advanced Plan" features. =
$29.95/month ($299.50/year)
<p>
All accounts have free account setup, =
24/7 personal technical support from 3 forms of contact, PHP/CGI/SSH, =
Frontpage support, etc.
<p>
Obviously these plans are not perfect for =
everybody, so we encourage you to eMail us with your personal needs for =
hosting. We can set you up with a custom account tailored just for you. =
Just send us your estimated requirements, and we'll give you a quote.
<p=
>
Of course, people make mistakes or possible don't anticipate the =
amount of resources needed, so if you ever come close to or exceed your =
quota, you generally will not be charged unless it is over 15% of your =
plan's limits. You will always be notified before you exceed your plans =
limits, and you will always have the option to upgrade to a higher plan =
in that event. You will never be charged for something without your =
prior knowledge.
<p>
Well, I certainly hope to hear back from you. Feel =
free to eMail me personally with your needs and we can get started =
tailoring an account just for you.
<p>
Thanks for your time.. :-)
