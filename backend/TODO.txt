    - Log the times for search and insert into the conversation collection

    - Insert the envelope once we've the ConversationID
    
    - Function to create and populate a DB por unittesting

    - Think about what to do with messages without Message-ID field

    - create a new archive with only mails (no chats)

    - When the message failed to enter (validation error, or error on save) generate a rebound
      using our message sending system (when implemented :) 

    - Convert main.d to a class? and db.d?

    - Exception classes for the different parts (and use them)

    - Const, immutable, pure, nothrow, in, out, safe et all

    - Initial configuration script

    - Retriever's full test, use a Python script with the mail & smtp modules to parse
      the test mails collection changing the receiver from [myRealAddr] to [mongoTestAddr]
      before delivering to Postfix, create a MongoDB database "webmailtest", populate it,
      check that we receive every email, check that that the isValidAddress check is fine,
      check that the filters of the test DB apply correctly

    - Sent the new changes in characterencodings.d to ruppe 

    - See how to get around Mongo's 16MB document limit (GridFS?) Check is some email of my
