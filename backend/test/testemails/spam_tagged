Hello My Dearest, please I need your help!


                Please exercise a little patience and read through my mail,
kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself to you, I am   Miss
Mawusi Kofi Awoonor 22 years old Female from Ghana, West Africa, we were
born three in our Family, two girls and one boy, I am the first  Daughter
of my Late Father Prof. Kofi Awoonor.  My Late Father is well known as a
Ghanaian poet and one of the African distinguished literary  figures, he
served as Ghana's ambassador to Brazil and Cuba in 1980s, as well as United
Nations envoy during the 1990-94 presidency of Jerry  Rawlings. My Father
with my lovely Mum, my only blood brother was among the scores of people
killed by Al Qaeda-aligned terrorists who attacked a busy shopping mall in
Nairobi, Kenya on September, 21, 2013. when members of Al Shabab, a
Somali-based militia, seized the Westgate Shopping Mall in a hail of
bullets in Kenya's worst terrorist attack.

Please after reading my mail reply me at mawusikofiawoonor@yahoo.com

You can read more about the incident with some pictures and a video after
the attack in Westgate Shopping Mall with the link below:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2432943/Kenya-Westgate-mall-attack-video-shows-gaping-chasm-3-storeys-collapsed-siege.html

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I  am
receiving from my wicked uncle who have planned to take away all my late
father's treasury and properties from me and my only Sister since the
unexpected death of my beloved parents, I was very lucky that my  uncle did
not discover where I kept my father's File which contained some important
documents. Now I am presently staying in the  Mission refugee camp here in
Burkina Faso with my kid sister. I am seeking for long term relationship
and investment assistance.  My father of blessed  memory deposited the sum
of $18.3 Million in Bank Of Africa here in Burkina Faso with my name as the
next of kin. I had contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch
Manager told me that being place an instruction on the fund that I must
present a foreign trustee who will help me in investment of the fund.
However, he advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf for
the transfer. I had wanted to inform my uncle about this deposit but I am
afraid that he will not offer me and my kid sister anything after the
release of the money because he threaten to kill us after selling some of
my Father's properties.


Please I am seeking for your help in transferring the money into your bank
account while we will relocate to your country to settle down with  you. As
you indicate your interest to help me I will give you the account number
and the contact of the bank where my late beloved father  deposited the
money with my name as the next of kin. It is my intention to compensate you
with 30% of the total fund for your assistance and  the balance shall be my
capital investment in any profitable venture which you will recommend to me
as I have no idea about foreign investment.

Yours Sincerely
Mawusi Kofi Awoonor
