Backend-API:
    - POST /message/:id/send
    DECIDE: the body (possibly multipart/alternative with attachments et al, but
    attachments should already have their data structure uploaded), is generated
    by the javascript client or the server?
    
    Generate the header["Content-Type"] field and the string body. 
    Use smtp module and the configured smtphost, smtplogin and smtppass, connect
    to the configured SMTP, send the generated raw email, update the document with
    sendDate: (date) and remove draft status.

Backend-Retriever:

    Later:
    - general hunting of XXX and FIXMEs

    - Use log to log more warnings, specially on db.*

    - When the message failed to enter (validation error, or error on save)
      generate a rebound using our message sending system (when implemented)

    - Exception classes for the different parts that throw.

    - Retriever's integration test, use a Python script with the mail & smtp modules to
      parse the test mails collection changing the receiver from [myRealAddr] to
      [mongoTestAddr] before delivering to Postfix, create a MongoDB database
      "webmailtest", populate it, check that we receive every email, check that
      that the isValidAddress check is fine, check that the filters of the test DB
      apply correctly, check searches with the indexer, et cetera.

    - Sent the new changes in characterencodings.d to Ruppe

    - When adding or removing links from a conversation, update conversation.lastDate

Frontend:

Contacts:
    - When a message is received and the email is not found on the Contacts collection,
      store as a new contact with Name, Surname, Email, Tags and put the tag "autoinserted".

    - Use it for getting the shortnames in the ConversationSummary object.

All:
    - Write more dirty tests, most of them are clean

    - Run dub with code converage option

    - Import cleanup (only imports and symbols really used)

    - See how to get around Mongo's 16MB document limit for bigger emails
      (GridFS?) Check is some email of my collection is bigger than 16MB without
      attachments (=> no)

Installation/Configuration system:
    - make it almost-dumb-proof with a script-wizard (or web page) to:
      - check versions
      - install and configure he Linux packages (postfix, mongo, dub, D compiler, etc)
      - configure the mail system domain (ask for passwords, initial users, etc)
      - test the mail system
