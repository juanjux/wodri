I don't feel strongly about these styles but I do about having some uniformity in
the code.

- camelCase in code and mongo fields but not for paths (paths are all lowecase)

- don't name members like m_someMember, use "this.someMember"

- Symbol names: better to be long and clear than to be short and concise (but
  short and clear is preferred).

- Allman style braces:
    void someFunc()  
    {
        if (bla)
        {
            dfsdf;
            dfsdf;
        }
        else
        {
            dfdsf;
            ewrw;
        }
    }
    But:
        - Single statements after if, foreach, etc without braces (except if they're hard
          wrapped and you think they look better / clearer with braces).

- "id" like in "userId" goes at the end both for code and DB fields. Inside
  camelized words is "someId" not "someID"

- "email" not "mail"

- Verbs to put something somehwere:
  - Database: store
  - Disk: save

- The IncomingMail.header member DictionaryList object is case insensitive, but
  please use lowercase for keys.

- unittests should print a "Testing bla" message at the start where "bla" should
  briefly describe the test purpose
