Backend-API:

    Unittest everything!!!

    `(MISSING) post: /email/draft`
        - Missing/empty fields in the stored draft:
            - message-id (create when storing) => move to common.utils

        - Attachments: will be downloaded/deleted by a separate RPC, see how to integrate
          it with the draft save/create RPC (first step: DONT overwrite the email.attachments 
          when updating the draft).

Backend-Retriever:
    - unittests for all things in utils.d

    Later:
    - Use log to log more warnings, specially on db.*

    - When the message failed to enter (validation error, or error on save)
      generate a rebound using our message sending system (when implemented)

    - Exception classes for the different parts that throw.

    - Retriever's full test, use a Python script with the mail & smtp modules to
      parse the test mails collection changing the receiver from [myRealAddr] to
      [mongoTestAddr] before delivering to Postfix, create a MongoDB database
      "webmailtest", populate it, check that we receive every email, check that
      that the isValidAddress check is fine, check that the filters of the test DB
      apply correctly, check searches with the indexer, et cetera.

    - Sent the new changes in characterencodings.d to Ruppe

    - When adding or removing links from a conversation, update conversation.lastDate

Frontend:

Contacts:
    - When a message is received and the email is not found on the Contacts collection,
      store as a new contact with Name, Surname, Email, Tags and put the tag "autoinserted".
    - Use it for getting the shortnames in the ConversationSummary object.

All:
    - Authentication with scrypt hashing instead of MD5
    - Run dub with code converage option
    - Import cleanup (only imports and symbols really used)
    - Const, immutable, pure, nothrow, in, out, safe et all
    - See how to get around Mongo's 16MB document limit for bigger emails
      (GridFS?) Check is some email of my collection is bigger than 16MB without
      attachments (=> no)
