- Create the main retriever executable:
  - It will be run by postfix and the email will be given by stardart input
  - It should determine if the domain and recipient is in the To:, Cc: or Bcc: adresses and return -1 if not
  - An IncomingEmail object is created from the email text and the original email and attachments are
    saved to their storages.
  - The tagger process should start: check the SpamAssassin header, check the internal rules and
    check the user rules (a UserFilter class should be created) and tags will be added or removed to the
    IncomingEmail object.
  - Get a ConversationID for the email. If none exists, create a new one and set it to the IncomingEmail instance.
  - Store the object into MongoDB, get an id.
  - Create a temporal document with all the text parts and subject decoded, run the search indexer over it, delete it.
