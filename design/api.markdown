# OBJECTS

## MessageSummary
XXX update
Used to produce a list of messages from a conversation without
fully loading the mails (all the messages shown as a header when you load a
conversation, that is all except the last one or the one you click to expand) .
The relevant parts when clicked (full body, mimetypes, To, Cc, Bcc, link to
attachments) can be loaded without reloading what we already have.

- Subject
- From
- Date
- Attachment filenames
- First words of the text
- Author avatar icon URL

## Message
Same fields as the MessageSummary plus:

- BodyHtml
- BodyPlain
- Attachment URLs

## ConversationSummary
These are the entries shown on a tag list.

- NumMessages
- Authors
- Attachment filenames
- Subject
- Tags
- Date of the last message

## Conversation
These are show when the user click on a conversation summary on the tag list. 

- Messages: list of MessageSummary and/or Message objects ordered by date.
- Subject
- Tags

The messages list will contain messages and/or messagessummaries (identified by
its "MessageType" field in the JSON data). Usually, the last message of the
Conversation will be a full Message and the rest will be MessageSummary, but
sometimes, for example when the Conversation is the result of a search, other
messages will be full Messages too.

Clicking on a MessageSummary will trigger the load of the full Message. If the
user clicks on the "expand" link, all the messages will be fully loaded.


## Tag
- name
- color
- description
