    - Exception classes for the different parts that throw.

    - Retriever's full test, use a Python script with the mail & smtp modules to
      parse the test mails collection changing the receiver from [myRealAddr] to
      [mongoTestAddr] before delivering to Postfix, create a MongoDB database
      "webmailtest", populate it, check that we receive every email, check that
      that the isValidAddress check is fine, check that the filters of the test DB
      apply correctly, check searches with the indexer, et cetera.
