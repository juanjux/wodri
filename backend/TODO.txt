Backend-Retriever:
    - See why it cuts the email when inserting into Mongo at the symbol that Vim displays as "^@"
    - IncomingEmail: unify camelCase
    - Convert main.d to a class?
    - Identify where to make more unittests
    - processMailForAddress:
        - Get a ConverstationID (first search for the id of the email, then search for the references
          from last to first, any? => get the ConvId, add all the references too to the same ConvID,
          none? create new, add the email and the references)
    - Function to create and populate a DB por unittesting
    - When the message failed to enter (validation error, or error on save) generate a rebound
      using our message sending system (when implemented :).

    - Install and configure the indexer
    - Make the retriever index a copy of the message
    
    - main.d: configure DB name and connection data from a config file
    - Exception classes for the different parts (and use them)
    - Const, immutable, pure, nothrow, in, out, safe et all
    - Initial configuration script
    - document

    - Retriever's full test, use a Python script with the mail & smtp modules to parse
      the test mails collection changing the receiver from [myRealAddr] to [mongoTestAddr]
      before delivering to Postfix, create a MongoDB database "webmailtest", populate it,
      check that we receive every email, check that that the isValidAddress check is fine,
      check that the filters of the test DB apply correctly
