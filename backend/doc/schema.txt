DOMAIN

Information about a domain managed by this email system. The optional defaultUser
will receive all the email that goes to any address on the domain not owned by an
user. The domainAdmin will be able to change the domain settings. The postMaster
will receive warnings and errors.

{
    "_id"         : "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "defaultUser" : "<user Id>",
    "domainAdmin" : "<user Id>",
    "name"        : "foo.com",
    "postMaster"  : "<user Id>"
}

SETTINGS

Three documents, one for every module (retriever, API, frontend). The paths can
be absolute (starting with a "/") or relative. If relative, they'll be appended
to the "maindir" setting. The incomingMessageLimit is in bytes.

{
    "_id"                  : "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "attachmentStore"      : "path/for/attachments",
    "incomingMessageLimit" : 15728640,
    "mainDir"              : "/opt/mainSystemDir",
    "module"               : "retriever",
    "rawEmailStore"        : "path/for/rawemails",
    "smtpEncription"       : 0,
    "smtpPass"             : "somePasswordForTheOutgoingSMTPRelay",
    "smtpPort"             : 25,
    "smtpServer"           : "someSMTP.server.com",
    "smtpUser"             : "someUserForTheOutgoingSMTPRelay"
}

USER

User information.

{
    "_id"       : "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "addresses" : ["johnsmith@foo.com", "secretmail@foo.com"],
    "admin"     : false,
    "loginName" : "someUserLoginName",
    "name"      : "John",
    "surname"   : "Smith"
}

USERRULE

Contains rules that will match documents and actions to do on them

{
    "_id"                  : "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "action_addTags"       : ["sometag1", "sometag2"],
    "action_delete"        : false,
    "action_forwardTo"     : "",
    "action_markAsRead"    : true,
    "action_neverSpam"     : false,
    "action_noInbox"       : false,
    "action_setSpam"       : false,
    "destinationAccounts"  : ["john@foo.com", "secretmail@foo.com"],
    "match_bodyText"       : ["XXXBODYMATCHXXX"],
    "match_headers"        : {"From"                                 : "somedude@gmail.com"},
    "match_sizeRuleType"   : "GreaterThan",
    "match_totalSizeValue" : 100485760,
    "match_withAttachment" : false,
    "match_withHtml"       : false,
    "userId"               : "<rule owner user Id>"
}



ENVELOPE

By-user email metadata; emails are static and only 1 copy for all receivers,
Envelopes are one copy for every receiving address (so if a user get an email
to two address he owns, he'll have two envelopes but a single email).

{
    "_id"                : "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "destinationAddress" : "email@foo.com",
    "emailId"            : "<email Id>",
    "forwardTo"          : ["someotheremail@foo.com"],
    "userId"             : "<user Id>"
}

EMAIL

An email. Only the fields that would be displayed on the frontend gui are
stored on the database. A copy of the original email is kept on the filesystem
if the user wants to see the original email (could also be used for a database
recovery process).  Only a single copy of every email is stored in the DB, even
if the email is addresses for several users of the system; see the description
for the Envelope document.

Note: email["headers"] will contain all the headers except Message-ID and From because
they're outside the headers subdoc (for easier indexing by MongoDB). A header entry
is a list because some fields like "received" can be repeated several times; each
list item was an additional header entry in the original email.


{
        "_id"          : "<ThisDocumentId>",
        "message-id"   : "0fbf60d6-da2d-45ad-a937-fe435c679be8@a70g2000hsh.googlegroups.com",

        "from" : {
                "rawValue"  : "Some Guy Name <someguy@gmail.com>",
                "addresses" : [ "someguy@gmail.com" ]
        },
        "receivers" : {
                "content"   : " NodLogin <nodlogin@googlegroups.com>",
                "addresses" : [ "nodlogin@googlegroups.com" ]
        },
        "textParts" : [ {
                        "content" : "Text content, plain or html (see contenttype for every part), already decoded into UTF-8",
                        "contentType" : "text/plain"

                    ],
                },
                "received": [

                ]
        }
}


CONVERSATION

Used to group different emails that form a single conversation. The frontend
could order them by plain+date, using threading, et cetera. The list has, for
every message, the message-id (as in the email heder), and the ID of the
document in the email collection (could be missing if there is a reference to
an email not in the database).

Tags are stored in conversations.

{
    "_id": "<ThisDocumentId>",
    "tags"              : ["inbox", "<OtherTags>"],
    "links": [
        {
            "emailId"   : "<some email id>",
            "messageId" : "CAGA-+RQDsMTnFegb_FYeiyHOFeSQc3cSw9uRY1a41L+vWEBB3g@mail.gmail.com"
        },
        {
            "emailId"   : "<another email id>",
            "messageId" : "DUB117-W199FD472475A8034B1A715A8870@phx.gbl"
        },
        {
            "emailId"   : "<third email in the conversation id>",
            "messageId" : "CAGA-+RTYnkF6OA-tzT+vBP4eL5LS_+gou7yVC0rZyVLCieQ_ng@mail.gmail.com"
        }
    ],
    "userId": "<user id>"
}
